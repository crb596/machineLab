## Project Draft: Flying Falcon

### Features

* Movement of falcon model in three directions
* Forward back movement for the hour
* Up and down movement on the half hours
* Wings flapping every 15 minutes

Timing will be done by using several sliders which control pushroads to keep the system in sync

A sensor would just be needed for the forward and back movement as all other movement is controlled by the continous rotation of motors.

The forward movement would need a stepper motor, all others could be standard DC motors with the speed altered for how quick the system should work.

Lighting under the piece would make it really pop at night (statues on highway by grand mosque as reference). Sound at the top of the hour could also make it more striking.
