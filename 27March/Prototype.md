### Sailing Ship Prototype

For this final project, I want to create an animatronic of a sailing ship. Classic Dow sailing ships are a predominant part of the UAE culture, and I think sailing ships are one of the most graceful things to look at. I have also spent a lot of time working on scale models and RC aircraft, both of which have applications to approaching this project in a way to make a moving and realistic-looking piece. 

As outlined in my project on the 6th of March proposal, one of the main mechanisms of this ship are the twin moving sails. I chose to utilize a singular servo motor as, while a more complicated mechanism, it will ensure synchronization between the masts and prevent collisions. It will also allow for easier scalability as half as many servos will be needed per ship.

#### Sail Mechanism

For this week we had to make a cardboard prototype of the most complicated mechanism. I designed the sails to move together similar to how I have seen RC aircraft use a single servo motor for both landing gear steering and rudder control, with a twin horn. The idea is that when the horn moves clockwise or anticlockwise, the top horn will always be pushing in the direction opposite of the bottom horn.

To make this work I made two control rods out of cardboard and fastened them with copper wire. While not the most strong, this allowed for the control arms to rotate as needed to stay parallel with the ship while staying fastened to the servo arm for control authority. 

These control arms then push on slats connected to the sail mast. While they can't pull as a control rod does on a linked horn attached to a control surface as is done in RC models, by having at least one of the two control arms pushing on opposite sides, the need for pulling the surface is eliminated. 

Finally, all of this had to be brought together in a way that allowed free, non-binding, movement while keeping everything in place and not slipping. To do this I created small stoppers that kept the mast in position but would not interfere with 45 degrees of forward or backward movement. Side walls also kept the mast's bases from wandering as they are rotated. Holes where the deck of the ship will also stabilize the masts and keep them in place. In the final version, the mast can also be secured at the bottom below the pushrods to have even greater stability.
