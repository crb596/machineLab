# Cardboard Automata

## Build

This project was my first introduction to several new building techniques including working with cardboard building moving parts in a mechanical system from scratch. I was very surprised at how well the cardboard work and how strong it can be when supported.There is considerable movement in the project and it holds up fine just with hot glue. For the slider, I was inspired by the wheels of old steam trains and tried to make everything inline. I was very happy with how this came out and think it was the most fun part of the project to design. Pinning the cardboard with the dowels made for smooth movement and kept everything very orderly. Here is a picture of the crank connected to the connecting arm.

I was also surprised by how flexible working with cardboard was. I am used to working with PLA, wood, or metal where everything has to be perfectly designed and cut to work and there is no room for error. In the case of cardboard it was easy to make on-the-go modifications and extensions such as here where a very simple glue extended my base out which took seconds instead of the lengthy process it would have been with other materials.

Here is a video overview of the whole system working!

## Failure Points

The first issue I had was with the design of the slider and connecting arm. I realized the ratio is very important to get right. Originally my cam was far too big and my connecting arm was far too small meaning the slider had very little chance to move horizontally and would have a lot of vertical force on it causing failure. I ended up making the connecting arm a lot bigger by extending the base and shortening down the crank which resolved that issue.

A second issue with the slider I ran into was that the slider would catch on the top of its enclosure and jam the whole system. To resolve this I gave it a little more height in the enclosure which results in a slight space for the slider to move vertically but not enough to compromise its horizontal movement. I also recut the slider to ensure it was as smooth as possible to try and prevent it from getting caught.

Finally, I also had to deal with the motor attachment point. As the skewer narrows it was hard to get the motor to want to bond to that and be even remotely centered as the glue wouldn't dry before the connection broke. To solve this issue I made a temporary stand that took the force off the hanging motor allowing the glue to dry to the wheel and triangle supports to the wheel. This extra time allowed it to be set into place without movement and allow a string bond to form. Once the glue was dry I could remove the support I made and it was attached no problem.
