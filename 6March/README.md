## UAE Clock Module Draft

The UAE has a rich maritime history including pearling, trade, and fishing. A large part of transportation in the region was carried out through stunning sailing ships that are iconic symbols to the region. Traditional dhows have an elegance that I want to caputure in this clock piece. Through the coordinated turns of the ships, and switching of the sail positions, life will be brought to the piece that makes it visually interesting as well through movement. 

### Diagram of Piece

The ships floating on supports over the sandy bottom will be an artistic repersentation of the ships at sea. There will be two ships that are synchronized and feature cloth sails mounted to masts which can turn. Other elements could include pearl oysters on the bottom and maybe divers underwater.
