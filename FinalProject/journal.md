### Final Project Journal

#### All progress is recorded here

Today a prototype of how the changed sail structure could look. Switching from western square sails that are controler by the mast rotating or a boom rotating to more traidtional triangular sails will make the model look much better.
The next step will be attatching the rigging to a stepper motor to see how well it works.

Last class I began making a CAD model for the ship hull. I want to use the scene shop's cnc mill. I will mill out the inside of the hull and then flip it to do the hull curvature.

I also changed the design of how the sails will work a bit. I still want to use Lateen sails as it will look much better, but the sail changing mechnism has to be a little different to be realistic and buildable with servo/stepper motors.

Here is a nice video of tacking with lateen sails which is what I want to recreate. In this case, when they are switching to a port tack, they are not detatching the sail from the port side and moving it over but rather letting it back up onto the mast. As disconnecting would be hard with motors, this will be the effect I am going for.

This upcoming class/weekend I want the prototype and cad completly done so that when I come to class on Tuesday I can focus on producing parts that are for the final example.
