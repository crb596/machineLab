### Final Project Journal

#### All progress is recorded here

Today a prototype of how the changed sail structure could look. Switching from western square sails that are controler by the mast rotating or a boom rotating to more traidtional triangular sails will make the model look much better.
The next step will be attatching the rigging to a stepper motor to see how well it works.

Last class I began making a CAD model for the ship hull. I want to use the scene shop's cnc mill. I will mill out the inside of the hull and then flip it to do the hull curvature.

I also changed the design of how the sails will work a bit. I still want to use Lateen sails as it will look much better, but the sail changing mechnism has to be a little different to be realistic and buildable with servo/stepper motors.

Here is a nice video of tacking with lateen sails which is what I want to recreate. In this case, when they are switching to a port tack, they are not detatching the sail from the port side and moving it over but rather letting it back up onto the mast. As disconnecting would be hard with motors, this will be the effect I am going for.

This upcoming class/weekend I want the prototype and cad completly done so that when I come to class on Tuesday I can focus on producing parts that are for the final example.

I have made good progress this week. I think this upcoming week I will be able to assemble the first working ship.

I have a CAD model I am ready to mill, and have reached out to Steven to sort out how to go about doing that. In addition, the model has extra decorations to make it look more realistic. I am going to 3D print these pieces and put them on afterwords. My main concern is how I can paint these pieces, but THey do not have to match the wood perfectly and even if they are flat black will look ok. 

One of the biggest challenges I had was moving a mesh to fusion360 object. I figured out I could convert it to a surface within Fusion, and all of this is exportable to STL. I need to check with Steven, but at least for 3D printing this will work. For the deck, I want it to come off to be able to work on the motors and board underneath. I think I could laser cut plywood if we have for this part.
