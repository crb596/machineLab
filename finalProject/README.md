### Final Project Plan

First step will me mocking up what I need in CAD

Using Fusion360 I will create a model with moving components. This will make the whole process easier as I can know the cuts for the wood I need before hand. For the more complicated hull of the boat I need a model anyhow as I want to machine it to make it look more realistic.

After I have a CAD model the next protoyping step will be using a combination of the mill foam for testing and wood parts to make sure fitment is alright and movement is unobstructed.

On the first workday I will work on getting the CAD model finished
